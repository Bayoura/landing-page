# The Odin Project - Landing Page

The assignment was to create a web page based on a given design. However, you were free to substitute your own content into the design (which I did). This page was build with only HTML and CSS.

## What I learned
I learned more about margin collapsing and margin "bleeding" while building this web page. Collapsing means that the top and bottom margins of adjacent elements collapse into each other. Only a single margin remains whose value won't be the sum of the two collapsed margins, but rather just the value of the bigger margin between the two.
This can also happen between a parent element and its first or last child (the child's margin "bleeds" out of the parent). To prevent this you can put a border, padding or inline content. 

This exercise is part of the Odin Project's curriculum.
